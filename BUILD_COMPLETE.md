## 📱 Setup Options

### Option A: XcodeGen (Fastest)

```bash
cd IntrinsicValue
./generate-project.sh
open IntrinsicValue.xcodeproj
```

### Option B: Manual (10 minutes)

1. Create new iOS App project in Xcode
2. Name it "IntrinsicValue", SwiftUI, Swift
3. Delete default files
4. Add all files from `IntrinsicValue/IntrinsicValue/`
5. Configure signing & capabilities
6. Run (⌘R)

**See:** [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed steps
